# Trippidy Server Integration Tests
This is a project for REST API integration tests for the Trippidy server

# Run Instructions
- Copy trippidy.properties.template to trippidy.properties and fill in values. I can send them by email as I do not want them to be present in a public repository.
- Change the RestAssured.baseURI domain in dev.koten.trippidy.TrippiddyTest to the one where your server is running or just test my server instance.
